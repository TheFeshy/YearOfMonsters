\Mhead{Concept}

Almost two decades ago, a town was ravaged by a series of horrific murders and maimings, carried out by what the police believe was a demonic cult.  They only stopped when the cult turned on itself, decaptiating its own leader.  

But the police were wrong, and something far more dangerous than mere human cultists were at work: a creature of, and obsesed by, bones.  Now, 18 years later, the killings have started up again.

\Mhead{Hook}

A killing in a quiet suburb, with cult-like overtones and missing body parts.  But what really stands out is the \emph{extra} body part:  A skull, engraved with occult symbols, that has been identified as one that was never recovered from a similar string of murders that ended 18 years ago.

\Mhead{Background}

Twenty years prior, a bored group of honor students at Laguna Bay High School did what countless teenagers have done before them:  dabbled in the occult.  They succeeded in their twin goals of entertaining themselves and making their parents very worried.  Likely it would have ended at graduation, and all the "cultists" would have gone on college and then to productive suburban lives.

Instead, Allen Roberson, ever the overachiever, decided to add some realism to their goofing around with some authentic historical chants and rituals in a genuine occult language.  Unfortunately for everyone involved, this attracted the attention of an equally authentic horror: the Bone Collector.

The Bone Collector is an immortal terror which has constructed itself out of the bones it collects.  It gathers only the very finest and most interesting bones, according to its own criteria.  The bones of a formerly extinct cult got its attention and drew it to town.  Concealed in a dark robe similar to what the cultist teenagers had been seen in, it took several bones it found interesting from the townsfolk:  The finger of a priest, upon which he had worn an ecclesiastical ring; the breastbone of the woman who ran the town food bank, the arm bone of a popular wrestler, and more.  

All the surviving victims reported a hooded attacker wearing a skeletal mask, and blame fell squarely on the teenagers.  The good nature of the victims was proof, to the townspeople, that demon-worshipers were among them.

Allen, however, figured out that their ritual had attracted the notice of something supernatural.  Worse, he believed he knew what it was \emph{really} after:  The night of their first ritual, he had invadverntantly gotten his girlfriend, another cultist named Desiree Curry, pregnant. The child of cultists concieved in a ritual would be a very tempting target indeed.

\imageRight[width=2.2in, margin=0.5in, position=center]{engraved2}{%
To protect his unborn child, Allen performed a ritual to painfully engrave his own skull, still inside his  head, with runes as both a lure and a trap for the beast. The beast took the bait and the trap worked - for a time. The magic only held The Collector for 6660 days (just over 18 years.) Now the Bone Collector is once again loose upon Laguna Bay - and it still has the scent of Allen and Desiree's daughter: Traci Curry, now a teenager.

\mhead{Play Notes}

Feel free to use the Keeper move \emph{Reveal off-screen badness} to reveal flashbacks of the prior murders and the teenage cult's infighting / scrambling to protect itself, if that fits your narrative.

\Countdown%
{Jim Holsted, a local auto mechanic, is found dead - aparently beaten to death with the long-missing skull of Allen Roberson.  His hand has been stolen.}
{A local animal rescue is raided, and most of its animals killed.  The more unusual ones are mutilated (they are missing bones related to what made them unique).}
{Three more human victims are attacked, and two are killed}
{The collector steals the bones of at least a dozen people around town, killing several, in an effort to gather a large amount of raw material for its Bone Web quickly.  The pacing of the attacks is much faster than before.}
{Traci Curry is killed when her skull is stolen, forming the centerpiece of the Bone Collector's web.}
{The Bone Collector breaks down himself and his Bone Web, and re-forms six Bone Collectors from the pile. Each heads in a different direction in search of new bones to start new webs with.}

\Cast{The Bone Collector}{monster}{collector}

\imageLeft[width=2.4in, margin=1.0in, position=center, indent=0in]{hood}{%
Made of bizarrely jointed bones, engraved with strange rune-like carvings, the Bone Collector is an intimidating sight. Generally it attempts to disguise itself as human, wearing either heavy robes or a long coat and wide-brimmed hat.  But this is only successful if it is very dark - otherwise its skeletal nature is apparent.  So it prefers to hunt at night.}

It seeks out bones, which it only takes from the living or those it kills, from unusual people or creatures.  It then carves and enchants those bones, and adds them to its bone web - the source of its power.

It is a careful and methodical hunter, sending its Bone Puppet scouts to observe its prey, and striking while the prey is helpless by breaking into places that seemed secure.  It also likes to cover its tracks when possible; re-locking doors behind itself for instsance.

Even after all this time, it still has the scent of Traci, a child born to two cultists, which it will use as the centerpiece of its bone web.  However, a monster hunter's bones are also a very powerful draw and it will attempt to steal one or more bones from hunters if it gets the chance.  Like its other victims, it willattempt to strike while they are sleepig or otherwise defenseless.

\mhead{The Bone Web}

The Bone Web appears to be the web of an immense spider, except made from countless twisted and carved bones, and faintly sparkling with energy like tiny dew drops.  It and the Bone Collector are two sides of the same entity: the web is immobile, gathering and storing unearthly power to fuel the collector in its search for bones.  As long as the Web remains, the Bone Collector cannot be permanently harmed or slain.

As the Web and the Collector are one, the Collector will know instantly if the Web is attacked or damaged.

    \mStat{Resonant frequency}{The bones tinkle softly in the grotto's faint breeze, like an anatomical wind chime.  If the hunters can sustain just the right frequency, the whole thing will shatter like a wine glass}
    \mStat{Big Magic}{With a ritual, the web can be drained of its power.  Get creative with the requirements.  One possibility is that the living victims must be present.}
\end{mStatList}



\mhead{So you lost a bone}

Which bone was taken?  It might be as small as a finger, or as much as one or two of the major bones in an arm or leg.  Unless the Hunter is doomed, it is unlikely to be something fatal, like a skull. But it is up to the Keeper and the level of horror he wants to convey.  Hunters, as people of action, tend to have arm bones interesting to the Collector (the hand that slayed a vampire; the arm that once swung the Sword of Destiny, etc.) So those are likely targets.

The collector's claws are sharp as scalples and unnaturally deft - any bone it takes will be removed as if surgically, with little damage to the surrounding tissue.  So the Hunter will not be left unstable.  Bystanders are less sturdy than Hunters, and live or die after an extraction as the plot and themes demand.

There are two ways a hunter can restore a collected bone: firstly, they can retrieve the bone and a skilled surgeon can re-implant it.  The Collector's magic will have preserved it sufficiently for this purpose, though of course this will raise a lot of questions at the hospital (especially if The Collector has carved its runes into it.  Feel free to have these have some lasting effect on the hunter!)

The second way is if the bone is ground into a dust, which is in turn used in a Big Magic ritual to re-grow the bone.

Both of these methods depend on retrieving the bone from The Collector - so if it escapes, or the bones are destroyed in such a manner that retrieving even the dust is impossible, the Hunter will have to replace their lost limb in some other lore-appropriate way (mad-science cybernetics, a graft from some regenerating creature, etc.)

\Cast{Bone Puppet}{minion}{scout}

Not all bones are of sufficient quality to incorporate into the Collector's web or itself.  These it makes into Bone Puppets, to serve as scouts to help it track and understand its prey.  The simplest of these creatures is a skeletal hand, crawling about on its fingers. This is what it does with the hand of Jim Holsted, its first victim at the start of the mystery.  With a little more time to work, these bone puppets could look like anything; assembled out of bone like lego. 

The Bone Collector can sense through these puppets if it concentrates on them, allowing it to build up a picture of its victim's habits and security.

The puppets will flee if confronted, but if forced to attack (to defend the Bone Collector or the web, for instance) they will try to use the keeper harm moves to disarm and harry opponents until The Collector can dispatch them.

\Mhead{Bystanders and Locations}

\imageCredit{Tracy}{dreamstime}{Royalty-free}
\imageLeft[width=1.5in, margin=0.5in, position=center]{tracy4}{%
\Cast{Tracy Curry (Daughter)}{bystander}{victim}

Desiree was always slightly jealous that her mother got to live in such an \emph{interesting} time in Laguna Bay's history - a real cult!  For Desiree's whole life, it's been nothing but a boring suburb.  It's so uninteresting that her mother is \emph{way} over-reacting to her goth phase, which would be considered perfectly normal teenage behavior in any \emph{interesting} city.}

\Cast{Desiree Curry (Mother)}{bystander}{helper}

Desiree is frantic with the return of the Collector.  She's never told Tracy the truth of what happened - to her, or her father, or even that she was in the cult.  Now she wants to take Tracy and run, but Tracy isn't having it.  As such, she's desperate for any action she can take to protect her daughter.  Allen never told her the full story, but she knows that what is happening is out of the police's hands.  

She's also worried that Tracy's goth phase is really a cult phase, and that she's putting herself in the same danger she and Allen did.

\Cast{Mortimer Sacks (language teacher)}{bystander}{witness}

\imageCredit{mortimer}{miyeon}{CC0}
\imageRight[width=1.4in, margin=0.5in, position=center]{mortimer4}{%
Mortimer had a passion for languages.  Not only ones like Spanish and French; those he teaches at LBHS.  For Mortimer, he older and more obscure the better.  So when he finally got a student (Allen) that shared his passion, he enthusastically tried to teach him everything he knew about ancient occult tongues.  After Allen's death (believed to be at the hands of the cult), he's realized the recklessness of his actions and never repeated them.  He also feels he paid for them: he woke the morning before Allen's death to find the "cult" had taken  his leg.  He now wears a prostetic.}

\Cast{Jake Timberwood (Sherif)}{bystander}{official}

Jake was a new officer on the force back during the days of the cult, but what he saw then he'll never forget.  Bodies missing limbs, living victims cripled, and no discernable motive.  As Sherif, he wants to ensure nothing like that ever happens again in Laguna Bay.

He is very suspicious of any outsiders at the time of the new attacks.  At best, they are disaster tourists.  Possibly, they're perpetrators.

\Cast{Katie Franks (Wildlife Specialist)}{bystander}{gossip}

Katie faintly resembles some of the squirrels she used to keep in the wildlife refuge.  She will be absolutely devistated by the attack on her animals, many of which had unusual characteristics (\emph{"Laguna Bay has always had more than its share of misfits."})  She has a picture turned backwards on her wall; a photo of the whole LBHS "cult" of 20 years ago in their "cult" attire - she was a member.  She can't bear to look at it, nor throw it away.

\imageCredit[modified]{grotto}{}{CC0}
\imageLeft[width=2in, margin=0.5in]{grotto3}{%
\Cast{Laguna Bay Grotto}{location}{den}

The grotto was always a bit dangerous, but after Allen's body was found inside and it began attracting gawkers, the city had it sealed up (those seals have failed).  Deep inside is where the Bone Collector keeps the Bone Web; safe from prying eyes.  It is also often where it lurks during the day.}

\Cast{Old Railcar}{location}{wilds}

An old railcar dumped in a field so overgrown that the car is completely obscured.  This was where the bored kids of Laguna Bay held their cult rituals and hung out.  None of the surviving cultists have returned since Allen's death; they are too afraid.

\Cast{Holstead's Auto Repair and Lube}{location}{crossroads}

The scene of the newest murder, where Jim's body and Allen's missing skull were found.  The building was still locked up for the night when Jim was found inside.  Jake can often be found here; he is now obsessed with this case and returns often hoping for any helpful insight. Desiree might stop by to see if the rumors are true.

% TODO: move Jimmy
\Cast{Jim Holstead, Jr (Boyfriend)}{bystander}{skeptic}

By strange coincidence, Junior is dating Tracy.  He is dealing poorly with his dad's sudden and senseless death, and one of the reasons Tracy is unwilling to flee is not wanting to abandon Junior, who in turn won't abandon his dad's funeral preperations or family business.
