\Mhead{Concept}

At the edge of a suburb in the Pacific Northwest, a huge C-Mart box store, the largest in North America, is built.  It's so big you could get lost in it.  Before long, exactly that begins to happen - people in the town start to go missing.  Several were last seen at the store.

The store has been built in what was, long ago, the heart of a Fae forest. The ancient protective magics - while weakened and failing - are still active.  The ward protected the Fae by disorientating any who entered, causing them to wander, unable to proceed or escape the woods.  Now, it's drawing them into a Fae version of the store, mixed by the waning magic with the ancient fae wilds.

The townsfolk are imprisoned in this twisted version of a mega store, and unless they can escape before the magics fail entirely, they will be trapped there forever.

\Mhead{Hook}

The hunters recieve an email from what appears to be a young child. "They've used magic to take my dad.  The police can't help.  Please come! My home is 123 Shade Tree lane. Fairlet Grove. My name is Timmy."  There's no explenation for who Timmy is or how he managed to find and contact a group of Hunters.  If that weren't enough of a draw, the email contains a "PS", with one secret known only to the Hunters.

\mhead{Play notes}

Things you might want to ask your hunters before play:  What is one secret only they know?  Which of them is likely to have fairy blood in their distant ancestry?

\Countdown%
{The ward pulls in people who meet two or more of these criteria: In the store at midnight, during a full moon, on a solstice, with distant fairy blood.  Only a few people are taken, spread out over months}
{The ward's activity increases, pulling in people from the store who meet only one of those criteria}
{Moonbeam attempts a ritual to shore up the Ward, which she casts in the city zoo due to the primal energy.  It fails, but several of the zoo's animals are taken by the ward}
{As the solstice approaches, people from the surrounding town begin to be pulled in to the Ward too}
{The moon reaches peak fullness in the Witching hour on the solstice, and the confluence of all three happening at once causing the ward to suck in hundreds of people throughout the town}
{The Fae Ward collapses, having spent all its energy, trapping everyone inside it forever}

\Mhead{Threats}

\Cast{Ancient Fae Ward}{phenomenon}{portal}

This ancient magic was used to protect these lands, drawing unwanted visitors into a confusing, maze-like version of the forest it guarded.  With the loss of the forest, and the dwindling power of the Heartwood, its maze has become a distorted mash-up of forest and superstore that Moonbeam calls "C-World."  This is where it places intruders now - when it has enough magical energy.  Its energy only builds to sufficient levels at certain times (see the Countdown for some examples, and feel free to add your own.)

Fairy creatures can avoid the ward or use it to travel as they wish.  They will also be able to sense its presence, and that all is not right with it.

The Ward is sustained by the Heartwood; see that section for details on how to deal with it.

\Cast{C-world (Fae Wood Superstore \mbox{Mash-up})}{phenomenon}{bubble}

C-world is fasioned from memories of the ancient fae forests that used to cover this land, mixed up with the aisles of goods and products that make up the C-mart big box store that fills that land now.  Huge trees grow between shelves of soda, their crown of leaves far above blending seemlessly with the sheet metal and skylights of the store.  Huge glowing mushrooms grow among the still-glowing televisions and phones of electronics.  Wild fae antelop equivalents roam the lawn section, feasting on the rich grasses.

Everywhere the hunters turn, they should see fairy plants and creatures learning to live in the "suburban wilds" of the box store.  Huge fairy birds have built comfortable nests in the clothing secton.  Tiny brownies have fasioned armor from bottlecaps, and sail a blimp stolen from the toy section to raid the snack aisle.  Great worms burrow beneath the furniture section, hunting any who attempt to take a rest in their endless wandering.

Unlike the physical box store, C-world has no fixed layout.  It is a magical maze, and so one day housewares might connect to sporting goods, and the next meats.  Or there might be a one-way passage from the pharmacy to toys.  In this sense, it is possible to roam the store for a lifetime, without ever reaching your destination.  No section leads to the exit.

C-world contains many biomes, not just forest (though that is the predominant one).  The frozen foods section is a tundra, lighting is a desert, appliances is a metalic scrap heap, seafood is an ocean, a whitewater river runs through sporting goods.  Get creative; the hunters shouldn't be surprised to find themselves swinging from tree to tree by electrical cord, or playing "the floor is lava" with a real floor of lava.

The maze is not unsolvable; but it uses a fae's whimsical intuition rather than a logical progression.  Hunters wishing to move to a specific section without a guide must roll +Weird:
\begin{itemize}
    \item On a 10+, the hunter reaches their desired section
    \item On a 7-9, the hunter chooses from among the following complications: They  must cross a dangerous section to reach their goal, they must pay a price to a fairy creature to reach their goal, the biome of the section they reach is not what they were expecting, or they reach their desired location only to find out it was an illusion.
    \item On a failure, they become disorientated, and are at the whims of the ward to deterine where they end up next.
\end{itemize}

\begin{mStatBlock}{Keeper Move}
    \mStat{Fairy Critter}{Introduce a new fairy critter that is finding a way to survive in the \mbox{store-forest} world.  Use this to inject comedy, weirdness, or horror as appropriate.}
\end{mStatBlock}

\Cast{Moonbeam Meadows (Changeling)}{minion}{guardian}

\emph{"I know it's a weird name; my parents were hippies".}

Moonbeam is a fae changeling, once charged with protecting the Heartwood.  As the great fae forests dwindled, most other fae left the land - but Moonbeam kept her post.  She was amused by living among the humans as one of them.

For decades, she prevented this land from being developed.  But eventually she ran out of tricks, and the land was cleared for first the town, then the store that stands on the site of the Heartwood itself.  She knows the Heartwood and the magics it sustains are dying, but she will see this duty through until the end.

Moonbeam did not expect the Wards to begin drawing in humans, nor for it to create the mismatch she calls C-world.  Despite the pain they've caused the fae, Moonbeam sympathizes with humans and would help them - but her fae nature prevent her from giving information or aid without a riddle or a trick.

That's why she has summoned the hunters with a faked e-mail from Timmy.  She got the secret from the Secret Keeper, to draw them in, and she will attempt to guide the hunters to the conclusion of the mystery. But only via trickery and deception, as is her way.

Her apperance is a mash-up of its own:  Rainbow eyeshadow and a different color of polish on every nail, combined with the dull green of C-mart's uniform.  She is bright and bubbly, cheerful and helpful.  So it's hard to blame her when her advice turns out to go so poorly, and even harder to notice the advice was designed to lead the hunters into danger.

She is C-mart's staffing manager, but is currently working several positions throughout the store due to the staffing shortages (between disappearances and workers being scared off)

\begin{mStatList}{Powers}
    \mStat{Faestep}{Moonbeam can travel between the human world and C-world at will, but she cannot take anyone with her}
\end{mStatList}

\Cast{Heartwood}{location}{fortress}

Once, the Heartwood was the greatest tree in the land, standing hundreds of feet above those around it.  It drew in energy from the forest around it, and fed it back out as life and magic.  But those forests are long gone now, and the Heartwood is a tiny sliver of its former self; barely more than a sapling.

It is currently glamouring itself to appear as just another ficus in the garden section, but it is not without other defenses:  It has turned the garden section into a thicket of tangled thorns, lashing vines, and flowers of appalling stench.

It knows its age is coming to a close - but it has hope, for in C-world it has seen fae and human creations surviving together.

%TODO end of mystery should involve, or possibly involve, the tree giving its seed to one of the hunters.  Which it will have to cary, like a pregnancy (except more like a tattoo)

% Maybe have some fae-language trickery, like "in order to give you the seed and close the ward, one of you will have to agree to stay and watch over the fae here."  Of course, they need only *agree* not actually stay, and that will be made clear - once they've made a decision.  But the Heartwood wants to know they are serious and can be trusted.

%Other options besides taking the seed should be bad - hack down the tree, half the town escapes (only half.)
